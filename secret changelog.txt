Bug fixes:
version number doesn't show on tutorial
settings cog doesn't cover erase-all button
fart sound doesn't change the pitch of other sounds
initial pen size stays the same after opening palette for the first time
spray can uses a less cpu intensive method of spreading dots around, works a bit better with large pen sizes
Eraser now actually saves (sorry!!)

New features:
Rainbow mode for every tool (Can also save and load rainbow mode stuff)
