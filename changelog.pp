Here's what's new in 1.4.4!

- Saving has been disabled since it just crashes the program and you can't
even take a screenshot of what you drew.

- This version of FAfP will probably be retired as the codebase is huge, bulky,
unreliable and I have no idea what's causing the saving issue. Expect a full
rewrite sometime in the next coming weeks/months idk ;3
