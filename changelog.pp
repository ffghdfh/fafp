Here's what's new in 1.4.3!
(again, WARNING: OLD SAVE FILES WON'T WORK and haven't worked since 1.4.2 
CONVERT THEM TO THE NEW FORMAT WITH THE BUTTON ON THE TITLE SCREEN!!!)

Bug fixes:
- fixed chance for infinite loop when loading a drawing
- fixed random lines in rainbow shapes
- fixed some very glaring issues in the tutorial

Other stuff:
- the pen color / size preview won't show when editing text
- you can now edit text just by typing
- you can add line breaks using enter now
- made the buttons on the title screen less of an eyesore
