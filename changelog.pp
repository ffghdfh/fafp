EMERGENCY BUGFIX UPDATE!!
Here's what's new in 1.3.1!

Bug fixes:
Fixed a coding error that handles uniform square creation, so now it's way easier to change the direction of the square / triangle / circle.
Fixed using A / D keys not updating the left toolbar.

Changes:
Changed palette slider to increment by 0.5 for finer pen size control.
Changed warning screen to reflect the ACTUAL issue with saving / loading.
Removed loading text + New loading screen image :) (made in the app)
