Here's what's new in 1.2!
Huge fixes:
Pen size now matches the palette menu's pen size from the start
Replaced some infinite loops to reduce processing load
Behind the scenes improvements (mostly helps me lol)
Fixed some weird undoing and redoing issues

Huge changes:
New palette menu (better preview, better shape buttons, better size picker, better color picker)
made pen preview borders make a bit more sense
You you can show both the predefined and custom colors in palette
Triangle tool has markers to show triangle's orientation
Brand new settings menu (separate from palette)
You can change which side the size slider is on (i'm left handed and was
a bit selfish when making the app so now right handed ppl can use it better)
